# Prometheus

Welcome to the Prometheus repo!

Prometheus is a collection of two recon scripts for Red Team and Web blackbox auditing:

- **asset_discovery**: a small script that allows to perform DNS asset discovery, Nuclei scans, determine used technologies, find known URLs, take screenshots of found web assets by combining the output of several tools.
- **blackbox_audit**: script that does a lot of blackbox tests (Ping, Nmap, DNS+DNSSec tests, sslscan + testssl) on a set of hosts you provide to the script.
